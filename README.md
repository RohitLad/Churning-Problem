# Churning-Problem
Deep Learning code for Churning problem in bank


Churning problem is basically to predict if a customer will drop his/her account from the bank.

We use sigmoid function to get a probability and use a dataset of 10000 cases divided into test and training set

Keras is used here.

This is really a basic implementation to check the capabilities of Keras (which are simple but impressive, I must say!!!)
